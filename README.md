# Marquis Finance Speedometer

The speedometer aims to achieve these specifications:

1. The gauge completion bar (gold gradient) should initiate a loading animation from 0 to the existing value upon page load.
2. The dynamic percentage values and numbers should include an ascending count animation, demonstrating a shift from 0% to the final value, possibly within a span of 3 seconds.
4. The map or GPS section acting as a timeline should begin at the start (as illustrated in the design) and reveal a moving animation on page load, depicting timeline progression based on the day of the month, resetting with the onset of a new month. Consider a slow, 5-second 'ease in, ease out' animation.
5. Linking the temperature icon to live weather updates. For simplicity, just the numerical value changes for now.
6. For static icons, the music icon could trigger an "engine starting" sound when clicked.
